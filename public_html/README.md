# iPinga
Vern's MVC Framework for PHP

This is actually version 3 of this package, but it is the first release since I put it on GitHub with the demo application

You can see the demo application live at http://dev.ipinga.com

There are two users you can play with...

     dick@example.com    and      jane@example.com
     
     Use "qwerty" for each of their passwords
     
Jane has more ACL privileges than Dick does, so login as both to see that.
